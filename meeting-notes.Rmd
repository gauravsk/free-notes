### Introduction to CESAB/Free  

Mechanisms of maintaining functional rarity; Evolutionary forces that generate functional rarity; geographic congruence or mismatch of rarity in taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional rarity.  

Scales of rarity-- time and spatial scales matter to defining and determining consequences of FR. (How) does scarcity at one scale influence community description?  

Decision of which traits to include might change statistical descriptors of rarity.  

Generation of triangular patterns in trait X spatial diversity

Metrics of rarity- average distance of species from the rest of the community? Or on a hypervolume?  

"Length of trait axis" is an interesting consideration-- often things are collapsed into "scaled" axes

### Day 2-- 29 May 2018  

- CT showed that uniqueness of a species depends on the traits yo choose- an important point.  

#### Matthias' funrar tutorial  

*code not run*
```{r, eval = F}
# This script installs all packages necessary for the tutorial to use `funrar`
# package
# Author: Matthias Greni√© <matthias.grenie[at]cefe.cnrs.fr>
# /!\ WARNING it creates a directory 'funrar_tutorial' in the current working
# directory, make sure to change the working directory if you want to install
# the tutorial folder elsewhere /!\

# Installing Packages ----------------------------------------------------------
# Install package `devtools` to install development version of `funrar`
if (!require("devtools")) {
    install.packages("devtools")
}

# Install development version of funrar
devtools::install_github("Rekyt/funrar", build_vignettes = TRUE)

# Install development version of `rdryad` if missing to download the example
# dataset
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rdryad")

# Install `ggplot2` if missing
if (!require("ggplot2")) {
    install.packages("ggplot2")
}


# Create Folders ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Create a tutorial directory in the current directory
if (!dir.exists("funrar_tutorial")) {
    dir.create("funrar_tutorial")
}

# Move to tutorial directory
setwd("funrar_tutorial")

if (!dir.exists("data")) {
    dir.create("data")
}

# Dowload Data -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Download the example dataset from Lawning et al. 2016
# <doi:10.5061/dryad.9t0n8>
tempfile("data/lawning_data.zip")
rdryad::dryad_fetch(
    rdryad::dryad_files(rdryad::handle2doi("10255/dryad.116171"))[1],
    destfile = "data/lawning_data.zip", mode = "wb")
unzip("data/lawning_data.zip", exdir = "data")
unlink("data/lawning_data.zip")
```

The metrics are as in the TREE paper.  

### Day 3- 30 May 2018  


#### Subgroup  

Annette suggests "if I had to make a model of this what would it look like" as a way of formalizing each mechanism- but a single model that allows for everything would be quite bloated  

NK suggests that a mass action model with a trait-fitness relationship might be simpler  

#### Assumptions  

1. We consider two traits that are relevant for a species' performance  
2. Globally, there is some fitness landscape across these traits-- some trait combinations are not viable anywhere; others are more or less fit.  
3. Each species' trait value determines its fitness in a given community (each community may have a distinct fitness landscape)  
4. The fitness landscape in a community is described by the distribution of resources    

#### More notes  

At local scale, environment and interactions influence rarity  

At regional scales, variation in space allows for positive growth rates at a wider range of traits.  

### Day 4  

ITV-- To make really clear predictions regarding the importance of ITV, I think we need to be clear about our assumptions about the underlying trait environment relationships.  

How to organize the effects of species interactions in driving (functional) rarity  

1. Competition, 
2. Mutualism (or lack of), 
3. Predation.

Predation can (probably) have various effects, but the simplest would be through changing the fitness landscape-- e.g. a trait combination has high fitness in the environment but is also rapidly consumed. There's also the potential for apparent competition (the presense of one species boosts a predator which then suppresses a second species to rarity).  

Mutualism may also have a straightforward influence on (functional) rarity -- for example, the presence of an extra-guild mutualist may bring in new areas of population growth rate where previously there was none. Similarly to apparent competition, the presence of a mutualist may boost a particular species that then suppresses a second species to rarity (e.g. via competition)  

Competition seems hardest to think about. Most simply, a particular trait combination may have an equal low-density growth rate to another, but there might be species differences in sensitivity to competition, due to variation in a third trait axis. This would result in no *trait* rarity, but in rare, common-traited species  
 
 
### Day 5  

ITV-- our expectations for ITV should change depending on why something is rare. The expectations for almost all cases depends on how we think the trait-environment relationship works. In this case it might be worth having simulations that allow for variable amount of variability whithin a species that also vary in their mean trait values. 

For practical terms it may also be worth doing simulations that include stochastic trait-environment relationships. For example, "In this environment, high SLA species have a higher likelihood of having a higher vital rate" -- and building in some nonlinearities in this would be ideal.  I wonder if this would be that much different from Simon's work.

Cyrille suggested that Enquist would be interested in thinking about trait driver theory and ITV
